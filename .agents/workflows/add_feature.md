description: How to add a new feature
---

When adding a new feature to the project, you must follow these steps to ensure quality and reliability:

1. **Understand Requirements**: Review the feature request and identify the specific requirements and affected components.
2. **Implement Feature**: Write the code to implement the new feature.
3. **Write Unit Tests**: Write unit tests that cover the new feature's functionality and edge cases.
4. **Run Unit Tests**: Execute the test suite to verify your changes. You must run the tests.
5. **Verify Tests Pass**: The unit test must ALWAYS be run and pass for a feature to be accepted. Ensure 100% of the relevant tests are passing.
6. **Iterate if Necessary**: If any unit test fails, debug and fix the implementation or test until all tests pass successfully. Do not finish the task or consider the feature accepted until this condition is met.
